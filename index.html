The EU taxonomy was a jumping off point for its creation.  It encompasses not only a green definition but a “broader mapping of transition and resiliency-linked economic activities and asset classes. It was intended to be ‘granular enough to avoid ambiguity, while flexible enough to evolve with policy, demand and innovation”. <br> <br> It is intended to work either independently, or with other countries with similar resource endowments, to develop supplemental coverage for industry transition activities that are essential to Canada but not captured under current criteria. <br> <br>Phase 1 would see the SFAC publishing a short-form taxonomy covering priority sectors and activities by mid-2023 (this deadline appears to have been missed), as well as laying the groundwork for the implementation of the taxonomy for the long term, including governance, funding and strategic planning.

                developer: 'The journey to develop a Canadian Taxonomy has not been a linear process. <br> <br> In 2019, The Canadian Expert Panel on Sustainable Finance recommended to the Canadian Government that the creation of a market-based tool to mobilise capital to transition to a net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions economy. <br> <br> Reacting to this, the Canadian financial community and eight industry sectors, including forestry, agriculture, mineral mining, utilities, steel, aluminium, cement, and energy, came together to collaborate on a foundational transition guidance document for the marketplace. The process was facilitated by CSA Group and resulted in the development of a volunteer committee on Transition and Sustainable Finance. The committee worked together over a two-year period, but there were fundamental differences of opinion among committee members, and consensus on the draft foundations document could not be achieved. The CSA Group determined that work of the committee had progressed as far as it could at that time. To determine next steps, CSA Group and the committee intend to work with the Sustainable Finance Action Council (SFAC) and government stakeholders. In May 2021, the Government of Canada launched the Sustainable Finance Action Council (SFAC) to help lead the Canadian financial sector towards integrating sustainable finance into standard industry practice. <br> <br> The SFAC serves as a centre of expertise, partnership, and dialogue on sustainable finance issues in Canada and internationally. It will also help champion the implementation of sustainable finance best practices across the Canadian financial sector and the broader Canadian economy, and support the growth of a well-functioning sustainable finance market in Canada. This will help accelerate movement of private capital in support of the Government of Canada’s climate goals, in particular: <br> <br> • to support the achievement of Canada’s enhanced 2030 target; <br> • to transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050; and, <br> • to ensure climate resilience and adaptation throughout Canada. <br> <br> The council’s early emphasis was to focus on enhancing climate-related financial disclosures in Canada’s private and public sector, aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. The Council also decided to prioritise gender and diversity reporting in a first instance. <br> <br> Three technical expert groups and one working group support the work of the SFAC and are comprised of SFAC organizations as core members, with expertise from industry, academia, civil society, and government incorporated to support progress on workplans. Of the four groups, the taxonomy working group (Lead: Barb Zvan, UPP Investments) was established to outline needs amongst market participants to define green and transition investments and activities within the context of Canada’s capital markets. <br> <br> At the same time as these efforts began, the CSA Group engaged Climate Bonds Initiative to explore the characteristics and approaches of international taxonomies within the Canadian context. It included a review of international taxonomies, focusing on their approaches toward low-carbon transition, along with the application of these approaches to the Canadian economic context. Through this exploration, the challenges and opportunities for the development of a Canadian taxonomy were identified. <br> <br> The report went on to propose and are presented recommendations that could inform a future Canadian transition taxonomy. <br> <br> The future governance proposed consists of a three-tier model: <br> <br> 1. A high-level body that is accountable for the initiative and provides strategic direction and oversight (Tier one); <br> <br> 2.	A technical custodian body with expert and technical staff that develops the standards and technical criteria (Tier two); and <br> <br> 3. Technical advisory groups comprising independent external experts that support the technical work of custodians, as well as forums and due process initiatives to obtain stakeholder feedback on consultation drafts (Tier three).',

The criteria can either be static or dynamic. Dynamic criteria are subject to a regular review process, where the criteria are made more stringent over time to reflect technological advancement and the need for increasing ambition as climate targets draw closer. The report provides an overview of a green and transition finance taxonomy with dynamic criteria. <br> <br> Taken together, the criteria are meant to support a theory of economy-wide change aimed at rapidly expanding green activities, decarbonizing higher-emitting sectors where possible and moving away from economic activities that are inconsistent with global climate objectives and carry significant transition risk. <br> <br> Designing a practical and credible taxonomy for Canada requires drawing boundaries around the types of activities that are consistent with 1.5 °C emissions pathways. These boundaries are important for oil and gas activities given their emissions profile, and they need to be analysed separately, but calibrating them appropriately is a complex undertaking that will require significant technical work and industry engagement in future implementation phases. <br> <br> To be categorized as transition, existing oil and gas projects would need to demonstrate improvements to their emissions intensity by 2030. Eligible projects would therefore need to demonstrate that current and future capital expenditures put them on a track to reduce their emissions intensity such that it complies with the 2030 threshold established via net-zero modeling. Eligible projects would also need to have lifespans that are proportionate to global demand scenarios in representative 1.5°C pathways (recognizing that the runway for gas is likely longer than for oil). Existing oil and gas extraction projects would also need to demonstrate that making the new investment to reduce emissions will not increase the lifespan of their operations',

This disclosure must include three tables for CapEx, OpEx and turnover, indicating the share of taxonomy-aligned activities, taxonomy-eligible but not aligned activities and non-taxonomy-eligible activities. In contrast financial undertakings were granted a two-year phase-in period for reporting, with alignment KPIs becoming mandatory in fiscal year 2023 — as financial undertakings will have to rely on data disclosed by their nonfinancial and financial counterparties to develop the indicators mandated by the Delegated Act. <br> <br> Additionally, from the reporting year 2022, credit institutions are required to disclose the proportion of their trading portfolio and on-demand interbank loans in their total assets. The insurers are to disclose the proportion of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-ineligible nonlife insurance and reinsurance economic activities. <br> <br> Further provisions came into effect on 1 January 2023: -	Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; -	Transition to a circular economy; -	Pollution prevention and control; -	Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems <br> <br> EU Regulations and Directives (known as Level 1, as described above regarding the Regulation) are often supplemented in more detail with what are and Level 2 measures that have a different legislative procedure to enable quicker amendment (Regulated Technical Standards/ Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) and Guidance. <br> <br> Following its publication, work started on the underlying Level 2 measures needed to supplement it. <br> <br> These relate to Key Performance Indicators - KPIs: Measures to specify the content, methodology and presentation of key performance indicators (KPIs) that non-financial undertakings and asset managers must disclose; and establishing TSCs to determine the conditions under which a given economic activity should be considered to be contributing substantially to an environmental objective.

Further targeted amendments to the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act set out economic activities that make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives of both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation but which have not been previously included in the taxonomy. <br> <br> The Measures applied as of January 2024. <br> <br> Further Interpretation and Guidance provided is included. <br> <br> Areas of future work: Macel Haag European Commission Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union Deputy Director has indicated that the key priority will be a simplified Taxonomy for SMEs. Other areas to watch will be the extension of biodiversity and further work on social taxonomy (December 2023 at CEPs think tank event on usability of the taxonomy see Utube video of the event). <br> <br> The current Taxonomy leaves a wide variety of economic activities non-classified. Some stakeholders may incorrectly interpret this non-classification or “not green” as a negative signal and there are fears that finance would simply disappear for activities that fall outside the current Taxonomy. To resolve this, An Extended Taxonomy could be designed to include intermediate as the current Regulation is not intended to define any category of activity other than “environmentally sustainable”; performing activities, significantly harmful activities and always significantly harmful activities.  The Commission would however need to identify further economic activities with no technological possibility of improving their environmental performance which was not in the scope of the existing taxonomy. The report published in March 2022 sets out how this could be done and the implications of this. Platform on Sustainable Finance’s report on environmental transition taxonomy (europa.eu). <br> <br> As noted by the report “Since the proposal of the Taxonomy Regulation (TR), it has become increasingly clear that many Taxonomy users could benefit from an extension of the Taxonomy framework to introduce other performance levels. Doing so would enhance transparency and would also allow for more nuanced decision-making and lend wider support to an environmental transition in the whole economy. The Taxonomy Regulation requires the European Commission to deliver a report on the possible extension of the Taxonomy to other economic activities. <br> <br> The report constitutes the Platform’s input to the European Commission’s forthcoming report under Article 26, and provides clear signals to and recommendations for financial markets and other stakeholders. <br> <br> The Platform has considered the premises, issues and options for and against extending the environmental Taxonomy ‘beyond green’ to classify a wider range of economic activities. We have consulted with a wide variety of potential Taxonomy users and published our interim report for public feedback. In addition to this work on an extended 6 environmental Taxonomy: focussing on the six environmental objectives and on transition across all sectors of the economy, the Platform has recently published its proposal for an EU Social Taxonomy, which is compatible and coherent with … this report.” The report however will be considered by the European Commission as it continues the way forward.',

To allow it to conclude its technical work and retain the expertise before the future Platform on sustainable finance is set up, the mandate of the TEG was extended until 30 September 2020 following which it was replaced by the Platform on Sustainable Finance. <br> <br> The Platform on Sustainable Finance plays a key role in enabling such cooperation by bringing together the best expertise on sustainability from the corporate and public sector, from industry as well as academia, civil society and the financial industry. The Platform was first established in October 2020, for a two-year mandate that ended in October 2022. A call for applications for the selection of members for the new mandate of the Platform was launched in October 2022 and the new composition of the Platform was announced on 8 February 2023. The first meeting will be held on 7 March 2023. <br> <br> Member States expert group on sustainable finance (E03603): The European Commission adopted its “Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth” on 8 March 2018 which proposed concrete actions that will help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives set in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change drawing on the recommendations of the High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance. In its Action Plan, the European Commission has called on other players, such as EU Member States, to support implementing sustainable finance actions and promote the transformation in their territories. For this purpose, the European Commission is creating a dedicated EU Member States expert group on sustainable finance.',
                objective: 'The EU recent Taxonomy Regulation aims to facilitate the transformation of the EU economy in alignment with its European Green Deal objectives, including the ambitious 2050 climate-neutrality goal by standardising the concept of environmentally sustainable investment across the EU. <br> <br> The Taxonomy outlines six key environmental objectives: <br> <br> 1.	Addressing climate change by mitigating its impact. <br> 2.	Adapting to the challenges posed by climate change. <br> 3.	Promoting sustainable management and protection of water and marine resources. <br> 4.	Encouraging the shift towards a circular economy. <br> 5.	Preventing and controlling pollution. <br> 6.	Safeguarding and rejuvenating biodiversity and ecosystems. <br> <br> The Taxonomy Regulation establishes a shared framework for defining what is considered "sustainable." This framework serves as the foundation for disclosure requirements and official labelling of financial products, as outlined in other Regulations and Directives. To provide some context, in December 2016, the European Commission formed a High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (HLEG) to guide the development of its sustainable finance roadmap. The HLEG recommendations formed the basis of the March 2018 Action Plan on Financing the Sustainable Growth. <br> <br> Creating an EU-wide classification system for green activities emerged as a top priority in both documents. In response, the Commission unveiled a comprehensive legislative package in May 2018, including the Taxonomy Regulation. Additionally, it established a Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (TEG) composed of 35 members from civil society, academia, business, and the finance sectors. With extensive input from scientific experts and various stakeholder consultations, the TEG produced a Final Report in March 2020. This report contained recommendations regarding the overall design of the taxonomy, practical implementation guidelines, and a comprehensive technical annex with screening criteria. <br> <br> The EU Taxonomy, as recommended by the TEG Final Report, was incorporated into the Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852, adopted in June 2020. This regulation encompasses the six environmental objectives mentioned earlier. The delegated act concerning climate change mitigation (CCM) and adaptation (CCA), released in April 2021, also originated from the TEG work. Meanwhile, the screening criteria for the remaining environmental objectives are currently in development. <br> <br> Furthermore, the Taxonomy Regulation established an EU Platform on Sustainable Finance, tasked with assisting the Commission in further developing the EU Taxonomy and its broader sustainable finance policy. In summary, the EU Taxonomy relies on the NACE economic activity classification system, which exists but is not widely utilized in Europe. An economic activity is deemed "environmentally sustainable" if it meets specific conditions outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation.',

However, enabling activities cannot lead to a ‘lock-in’ of assets which would undermine long-term environmental goals. They must also have a substantial positive environmental impact over the activity’s lifecycle. <br> <br> Transitional activities must contribute to climate change mitigation and a pathway to keeping global warming in line with Paris Agreement commitments. Transitional activities only qualify where the following criteria are met: <br> <br> •	There are no technologically or economically feasible low-carbon alternatives; <br> •	Green House Gas emission levels correspond to the best performance in the sector    or industry; and <br> •	The activity does not lead to carbon lock-in or hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives. <br> <br> Ineligible investment: None',

                Biodiversity: 'The SFPS 2023 Annual Report notes (bold added): <br> “The EU has taken further steps to address the dual challenges of climate and biodiversity crises. The EU employs a two-pronged approach that combines investment in nature and essential reforms to create the right social and economic context. A cornerstone of this commitment is the EU’s long-term strategy, which strives to restore biodiversity by 2030 and includes the proposal of the EU’s Nature Restoration Law, establishing binding restoration targets for specific habitats and species. Key to advancing these objectives is the EU’s robust framework for sustainable finance, built around the EU Taxonomy, which is gaining increasing importance in the context of biodiversity preservation. In June 2023, the European Commission extended the EU Taxonomy with the Environmental Delegated Act, showcasing the EU’s dedication to embedding biodiversity conservation and restoration criteria into the financial sector. This expansion has led to the introduction of a new set of criteria within the EU Taxonomy, targeting economic activities that make substantial contributions to non-climate environmental objectives. These criteria include provisions for the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Technical screening criteria have been developed to define activities, such as habitat, ecosystem, and species conservation and restoration, as well as those related to accommodations like hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds, and similar facilities. Expected to come into force as of January 2024, the Delegated Acts reflect the EU’s commitment to addressing the urgent issue of biodiversity preservation. To reinforce sustainability reporting, the EU has introduced the ESRS, with a significant emphasis on biodiversity within these standards. Biodiversity considerations are integrated into general disclosure standards and a dedicated standard, ESRS 4, entirely focused on biodiversity and ecosystems. ESRS 4 necessitates that companies transparently disclose material impacts, risks, and opportunities tied to biodiversity, clarifying their relevance to strategy and business models. <br> <br> Moreover, companies are required to report the processes employed for identifying and assessing material biodiversity and ecosystem-related aspects, along with details of targets, impact metrics, and potential financial implications. <br> <br> Complementing these initiatives, the European Commission has embarked on a proactive approach to address financial risks associated with biodiversity loss. A methodological framework and assessment of potential financial risks linked to biodiversity and ecosystem degradation are currently under development. This endeavour aims to guide financial market participants in assessing the financial risks of biodiversity loss and is set to be published in the first quarter of 2024.

It is designed to be applied to a wide range of financial instruments including corporate lending, consumer lending, project finance, SME finance, green bonds, equity investment, insurance, credit guarantee, grants, financial advisory and technical assistance, among others. The activities identified in this version of the taxonomy will be reviewed every 3-5 years following policy shifts, scientific developments, technological changes, and new industry needs in the green finance space. It is based on 6 principles: Contribute to national policies and targets; Address environmental challenges; Cover high-emitting, key economic sectors; Align with international standards and good practices; Comply with ESG standards; Continues review and development.',

Under the first focus area, the GFIT is exploring the development of a taxonomy for Singapore-based financial institutions, with particular relevance to those active across ASEAN. The GFIT held a consultation on their initial thinking around the potential development of a taxonomy which closed in March 2021. A second consultation paper was released on 12 May 2022, building on the broad support for the development of the Taxonomy reflected in the feedback received for the first consultation document, as well as key developments in the sustainability space. The second paper expands on the traffic light approach, and adds granularity to the application and thresholds for classification, supported by science and data.',
